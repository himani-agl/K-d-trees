# K-d-trees
C++ implementation  of k-d trees for nearest neighbour searching and range searching(find the points whithin the circle of radius r and centre as query point)
Let us be given points in d-dimensional Euclidean space. A K-d-tree is a binary tree where the underlying space is partitioned on the basis of the value of just one attribute (dimension) at each level of the tree, thereby making a tests at each level. For instance, we pick a dimension i<d and also a value p, such that all the points whose i-th coordinate value is less than p is assigned to the left subtree at this level and other points are assigned to the right subtree.This data structure is very useful while searching range queries, i.e., all those points that are within a certain distance of a given query point q. Let us for the moment assume that d = 3 and q = (a,b,c). If we want to find all the data points
that are less than distance 'r', it is sufficient to search the subtrees that have values in the range (r-a, r+a) for a particular dimension i, and similarly for the other attributes/ dimensions. Thus searching for neighbours within a range amounts to traversing through this data structure wisely.
The code creates 200 points from [-10, 10]^5, i.e., the points come from a 5-dimensional space with the max values along any dimension lying between -10 and 10.And construct a K-d-tree and given an arbitrary query point q and distance r, find the nearest neighbours of q that lie within this radius r, where the distance is the usual Euclidean distance. It later uses brute force algorithm to chechk weather the nearest neigbour is correct or not
